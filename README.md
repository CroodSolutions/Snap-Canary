# Snap-Canary

Snap Canary is intended to be a collection of easy steps and ideas, to get some deception going without having to buy expensive vendor solutions, bulding on the capabilities native to most environments (such as NDR/IDS, Custom IOAs, or UEBAs w/ account alerting). 

Many of us put off deception because it is perceived as expensive or difficult.  And, attaining world class deception may indeed be difficult and costly.  This project is intended to be a dumpster fire of cheap resources and cheat codes, to spin up highly mediocre deception, which will not win any awards (but it may save your bacon).  

This project consists of a folder of canary files you can modify and use, a playbook folder that we can all work to make useful one day, and a vibe generated 'what is deception' folder with content created by Gemini for anyone new to the topic (did not read it really, but a quick skim generated no red flags for beginner overview territory).  On the latter element, my greatest contribution was to get it from Google to GitHub markdown, which I assure you was no easy task. 

Disclaimer: These resources come with no warrantees or assurance, started as the late night ravings of a cyber madman, and could be of no value whatsoever.  Use at your own risk. My views (and the views of other contributors) are ours alone and do not represent the views of our employer or any other party.  

Now that the normal stuff is out of the way, we hope you use it, contriubte, and help improve the project over time.
